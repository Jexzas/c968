Kai never cared much for stares. He’d grown used to them—the sideways glances at his chest, the double-takes at his beard. He was a walking contradiction in most people's eyes, but to him, he was just... himself.
His body had always been a battleground. The hormones had gifted him thick, dark hair on his arms, his face, even his stomach. But his chest remained, stubborn and soft beneath oversized hoodies. Some days, he bound it. Other days, he didn’t bother. What was the point of comfort if he still had to fight for it?
At the café, a guy at the counter looked him up and down, confusion twisting his face. Kai met his gaze and smirked. Let him wonder.
"Name for the order?" the barista asked.
"Kai."
The guy scoffed. "That’s not a girl’s name."
Kai exhaled through his nose, grabbing his coffee when it was ready. As he turned to leave, he caught his reflection in the window. Hairy arms, broad shoulders, round chest. He didn’t fit the world's neat little boxes, but he fit himself just fine.
He ran a hand through his beard, chuckled, and took a sip of his coffee. Let them stare. He had better things to do than make sense to people who didn’t matter.
