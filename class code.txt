class code

clr = common language runtime. JIT comp
CLR converts to any native environment with the right compiler

Namespace: class of classes basically - related ones
assembly: executable or dll
compiler may build one or several assembly


in vs code a solution can include many projects

variables vs context
type name;
type name = data;
const type name = data;
adding f makes it a float rather than a double

Can't start with number
const has to be assigned immediately

### Primitive Types C# vs .NET types
Integrals
    byte    Byte
    short   Int16
    int     Int32
    long    Int64
Real Numbers
    float   Single
    double  Double
    decimal Decimal
Character
    char    Char
Boolean
    bool    Boolean  

double = 1.2;
float = 1.2f;
decimal = 1.2m;


f = float, decimal = m
overflowing.... exceeding capacity of data type, C# doesn't check unless you say checked
